# SPA Universe

SPA Universe is a Single Page Application (SPA) that explores different concepts of web development. This project was created as a practical exercise to demonstrate the implementation of various web development concepts, including routing, asynchronous operations, object-oriented programming, and more.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Lite Server (for local development)

## Project Overview

SPA Universe allows users to navigate through different sections, each containing relevant information about space and exploration. The project covers the following aspects:

- **Single Page Application:** SPA architecture is implemented, enabling seamless navigation without page reloads.

- **Routing:** The application utilizes custom routing to display content based on the URL.

- **Asynchronous Operations:** Fetch API is used to asynchronously load content from separate HTML files for each route.

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** The Router class is created to manage routes and their corresponding actions.

- **DOM Manipulation:** Content from fetched HTML files is dynamically inserted into the DOM to update the user interface.

- **Styling:** CSS is used to style the application, including responsive design and background switching.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/spa-universe.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd spa-universe`
3. Install dependencies: No additional dependencies are required.
4. Start the local development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file that loads the application.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the application.
- `js/index.js`: JavaScript entry point that sets up event listeners and initializes the Router.
- `js/router.js`: Router class responsible for managing routes and handling content loading.
- `js/backgroundSwitch.js`: JavaScript module for handling background switching based on navigation.
